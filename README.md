# covid-19-report
The first project in DTS 2023 FGA: Data Science is Covid - 19 Project. There are query SQL practice and data visualization of Covid - 19. Here is my project with my friend about that issue.

Corona Virus Disease 2019 or commonly abbreviated as COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a type of coronavirus. People with COVID-19 can experience fever, dry cough and difficulty breathing. The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the world for about 2 years and has had a negative impact on health and economic growth, especially in Indonesia.

The current condition of the COVID-19 pandemic that is occurring in Indonesia has also scored a death rate of 145,259,277 people (data 15 September 2022) from positive cases. Apart from that, the pandemic also affected the health system because there was stuttering from the government and health workers in dealing with COVID-19. Therefore, there is a need for follow-up from policy making to strengthen the health system through the allocation of funds/budgets that are right on target.

Through the Covid-19 distribution map, it is hoped that it can provide important data in handling the threat of the spread of the COVID-19 virus in Indonesia and can provide useful information to encourage efforts to deal with the virus with preventive steps. Here is the link of dashboard Covid - 19: https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/ee548f03-33f4-4d00-ac59-d949f8f003e7

There are 6 important parts on dashboard:
1. Columns for control of the distribution of data. Columns island for control island, province for control which province which want to display the data, date for control time, and location ISO Code for show the data based on location codes.
2. Cases update columns which explain the total of deaths, cases, recovered, and new active cases that have been recorded.
3. Map to show the total of cases in each province.
4. Table to show the total of cases in each province.
5. Chart to explain new cases, new deaths, new recovered, case fatality rate, and case recovered rate everyday.
6. Bar chart to show the total of deaths in each province per 100.000.
